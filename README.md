# molecular_docking


In these notebooks, Python scripting and libraries are used to explore ligand binding to enzymes. The corresponding Jupyter notebooks are customizable for individual research and teaching purposes. 

Perform advanced searches of the RCSB Protein Data Bank with the rcsb api package
Modify chemical structures with the rdkit library
Extract data from PDBx/mmCIF files (the native Protein Data Bank data file format) using the Biopython library
Dock ligands with enzymes, yielding visual and quantitative energy results
